Software? Yeah I know some great software. I had some guy with glasses build some software for me -- great guy, great glasses -- he was a whiz. Just sat there typing at his little computer and didn't even speak to me. I think it was a phone software, you know one of those things you swipe on your phone and someone brings you Pizza or a short term relationship. Anyway, technology is geat stuff. That reminds me of a story

Ok, what we're really trying to say here is "don't use my software."  "Don't use it." Ok? It's that simple; I think that's pretty simple. It's mine, I paid some dude to build it and I don't think it's fair that you can just use it without paying me. Isn't that what makes America great? I don't even need to know what is happening but I know it's good because I pick good people; I just know that I can turn around and sell it.
